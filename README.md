# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Developed a predictive model to forecast passenger survival, achieving 80% accuracy by implementing data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques.
Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using a machine learning model. 
The goal of the project is to build a classification model that accurately predicts which passengers survived the disaster based on a set of features.

Key Features

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: The raw dataset was cleaned and prepared for modeling.
Predictive Modeling: A Logistic Regression model was developed to predict passenger survival.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated, achieving an 80% accuracy score.

Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib (for data analysis and modeling).

Install Required Libraries:
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib

Run the Notebook:
Open the titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred environment and run the cells in order.

Project Insights
The model successfully predicted survival with a reliability of 80%.
Gender played a significant role in the survival rate.
Age and passenger class also had a notable impact on the outcome.
